## Course description

### Context

I expect computers in the next 700 years will be **massively parallel**. We the humankind want to
improve the performance of computers in the era of big data. But it is becoming more and more
challenging after the breakdown of [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling)
around 2005, which means the performance of sequential computers will not be improved. Thus not only
servers but also personal computers have been multi-core systems since then. The problem is only
worsened by the ending of the [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which
means we are no longer able to benefit from denser electrical circuit. It seems the only remaining
way to optimize performance is specialization, which aims to better exploit parallelism of
workloads. Because of these technology trends, I expect computers in the future will be massively
parallel.

But we are not ready yet for the era of massive parallelism. The main difficulty lies on handling
**shared mutable states**, which is the main topic of concurrency. To coordinate multiple cores and
other resources, their inputs and outputs should be somehow properly synchronized with each other
via shared mutable states like memory. But handling shared mutable states is inherently challenging,
both theoretically and practically. For example, in the presence of thousands and millions of cores,
how to efficiently synchronize concurrent accesses to shared memory? In the presence of
nondeterministic interleaving of thread executions, how to make sure the safety of a concurrent
program? In the presence of compiler and hardware optimizations, what is the right specification of
a concurrent data structure?

Fortunately, the theory of shared mutable states has advanced quite impressively in the past ten
years, which makes it greatly more comfortable in designing and analyzing practical systems with
shared mutable states. So in this course, we will discuss the recent theory of shared mutable states
and its application to real-world practical systems.


### Goal

This course is geared towards senior undergraduate (or graduate) students in computer science (or
related disciplines) who are interested in the modern theory and practice of parallel computer
systems. This course aims to help such students to:

- Understand the motivations and challenges in concurrent programming
- Learn design patterns and reasoning principles of concurrent programming
- Design, implement, and evaluate concurrent programs
- Apply the understanding to real-world parallel systems

- References
    + [The Art of Multiprocessor Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/2385452)
    + [The Crossbeam library documentation](https://docs.rs/crossbeam/latest/crossbeam/)
    + [C++ Concurrency in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/c-plus-plus-concurrency-in-action-second-edition)

### Prerequisites

- It is **strongly recommended** that students already took courses on:

    + Mathematics (MAS101): proposition statement and proof
    + Data structures (CS206): linked list, stack, queue
    + Systems programming (CS230) or Operating systems (CS330): memory layout, cache, lock
    + Programming principles (CS220) or Programming languages (CS320): lambda calculus, interpreter

  Without a proper understanding of these topics, you will likely struggle in this course.

- Other recommendations which would help you in this course:

    + Basic understanding of computer architecture (CS311)
    + Programming experience in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


### Tools

Make sure you're capable of using the following development tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): for downloading the homework skeleton and version-controlling your
  development. If you're not familiar with Git, walk through [this
  tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

    + Please do the following steps to set up your repository:

        * Directly clone the upstream without forking it.

          ```bash
          $ git clone --origin upstream git@github.com:kaist-cp/cs431.git
          $ cd cs431
          $ git remote -v
          upstream	git@github.com:kaist-cp/cs431.git (fetch)
          upstream	git@github.com:kaist-cp/cs431.git (push)
          ```

        * To get updates from the upstream, fetch and merge `upstream/main`.

          ```bash
          $ git fetch upstream
          $ git merge upstream/main
          ```

    + If you want to manage your development in a Git server, please create your own private
      repository.

        * You may upgrade your GitHub account to "PRO", which is free of charge.
          Refer to the [documentation](https://education.github.com/students).

        * Set up your repository as a remote.

          ```bash
          $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git
          $ git remote -v
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git (fetch)
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git (push)
          upstream git@github.com:kaist-cp/cs431.git (fetch)
          upstream git@github.com:kaist-cp/cs431.git (push)
          ```

        * Push to your repository.

          ```bash
          $ git push -u origin main
          ```

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): as the language of homework implementation. We chose Rust
  because its ownership type system greatly simplifies the development of large-scale system
  software.

  We recommend you to read [this page](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/helpdesk#technical-expertise) that describes how to study Rust.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional): for developing your homework. If you prefer other editors, you're good to go.

- [Development server](https://cloud.fearless.systems/)

    + **IMPORTANT: Don't try to hack. Don't try to freeze the server. Please be nice.**

    + Now you can [use it as a VSCode remote server as in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTVuUIhdn_g&list=PL5aMzERQ_OZ8RWqn-XiZLXm1IJuaQbXp0&index=3).

    + [NOTE: We recommend the `rust-analyzer` plugin instead of `rls`](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer).

    + [NOTE: If permission denied error occurs when trying to install `CodeLLDB Extension` into the 
      remote server](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues/5), please follow the steps: 
      1. Download [this file](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/releases/download/v1.5.0/codelldb-x86_64-linux.vsix) at the remote server.
      1. Follow [the instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix) to install it.

    + [NOTE: If you cannot connect to the remote server via VSCode with `fail to create hard link` error message](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues/91), please follow the steps:
      1. Close VSCode window and try to connect to the remote server via terminal(or cmd). If you encounter `Connection timed out` error message, try again after a few minutes.
      1. Delete all the files in `~/.vscode-server/bin/`.

### Cheating

**IMPORTANT: PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. VERY SERIOUS.**

- Please sign the KAIST CS Honor Code for this semester.
  Otherwise, you may be expelled from the course.

- We will use sophisticated tools for detecting code plagiarismâ€‹.

    + [Google "code plagiarism detector" for images](https://www.google.com/search?q=code+plagiarism+detector&tbm=isch) and see how these tools can detect "sophisticated" plagiarisms.
      You really cannot escape my catch. Just don't try plagiarism in any form.

    + Log in with your `kaist-cp-class` account.

    + Your id is your `@kaist.ac.kr` email address.

    + Reset your password here: https://auth.fearless.systems/if/flow/default-recovery-flow/

    + If you cannot log in, please contact the instructor.

### Rules

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431/issues).  You are expected to read all
  announcements within 24 hours of their being posted.  It is highly recommended to watch the
  repository so that new announcements will automatically be delivered to your email address.

- Ask questions on course materials and assignments in [this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431/issues).
    + Don't send emails to the instructor or TAs for course materials and assignments.
    + Before asking a question, search for it in Google and Stack Overflow.
    + Describe your question in as much detail as possible. It should include the following things:
      * Environment (OS, gcc, g++ version, and any other related program information).
      * Command(s) that you used and the result. Any logs should be formatted in code. Refer to [this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
      * Any directory or file changes you've made. If it is the solution file, just describe which part of the code is modified.
      * Googling result. Search before asking, and share the keyword used for searching and what you've learned from it.
    + Give a proper title to your issue.
    + Read [this](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431#communication) for more instructions.

    + I'm requiring you to ask questions online first for two reasons. First, clearly writing a
      question is the first step to reaching an answer. Second, you can benefit from the questions and answers of other students.

- Ask your questions via email **only if** they are either confidential or personal. Any questions
   failing to do so (e.g. email questions on course materials) will not be answered.

- We are NOT going to discuss *new* questions during office hours. Before coming to the office
  hour, please check if there is a similar question on the issue tracker. If there isn't, file a new
  issue and start discussion there. The agenda of the office hour will be the issues that are not
  resolved yet.

- Emails to the instructor or the head TA should begin with "CS431:" in the subject line, followed
  by a brief description of the purpose of your email. The content should at least contain your name
  and student number. Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.

- If you join the session remotely from Zoom (https://kaist.zoom.us/my/jeehoon.kang),
  your Zoom name should be `<your student number> <your name>` (e.g., `20071163 ê°•ì§€í›ˆ`).
  Change your name by referring to [this](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-Customizing-your-profile).

- This course is conducted in English. But you may ask questions in Korean. Then I will translate it to English.
