## Course description

### Context

I expect computers in the next 700 years will be **massively parallel**. We the humankind want to
improve the performance of computers in the era of big data. But it is becoming more and more
challenging after the breakdown of [Dennard scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling)
around 2005, which means the performance of sequential computers will not be improved. Thus not only
servers but also personal computers have been multi-core systems since then. The problem is only
worsened by the ending of the [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), which
means we are no longer able to benefit from denser electrical circuit. It seems the only remaining
way to optimize performance is specialization, which aims to better exploit parallelism of
workloads. Because of these technology trends, I expect computers in the future will be massively
parallel.

But we are not ready yet for the era of massive parallelism. The main difficulty lies on handling
**shared mutable states**, which is the main topic of concurrency. To coordinate multiple cores and
other resources, their inputs and outputs should be somehow properly synchronized with each other
via shared mutable states like memory. But handling shared mutable states is inherently challenging,
both theoretically and practically. For example, in the presence of thousands and millions of cores,
how to efficiently synchronize concurrent accesses to shared memory? In the presence of
nondeterministic interleaving of thread executions, how to make sure the safety of a concurrent
program? In the presence of compiler and hardware optimizations, what is the right specification of
a concurrent data structure?

Fortunately, the theory of shared mutable states has advanced quite impressively in the past ten
years, which makes it greatly more comfortable in designing and analyzing practical systems with
shared mutable states. So in this course, we will discuss the recent theory of shared mutable states
and its application to real-world practical systems.


### Goal

This course is geared towards senior undergraduate (or graduate) students in computer science (or
related disciplines) who are interested in the modern theory and practice of parallel computer
systems. This course aims to help such students to:

- Understand the motivations and challenges in concurrent programming
- Learn design patterns and reasoning principles of concurrent programming
- Design, implement, and evaluate concurrent programs
- Apply the understanding to real-world parallel systems


### Textbook

- [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NMg08N1LUNDPuMxNZ-UMbdH13p8LXgMM3esbWRMowhU/edit?usp=sharing)
- Classical papers and libraries
    + [Promising semantics](https://sf.snu.ac.kr/promise-concurrency/): programming language & architecture semantics for shared-memory concurrency
    + [Crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam): concurrent data structure library written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Prerequisites

- It is **strongly recommended** that students already took courses on:

    + Mathematics (MAS101): proposition statement and proof
    + Data structures (CS206): linked list, stack, queue
    + Systems programming (CS230) or Operating systems (CS330): memory layout, cache, lock
    + Programming principles (CS220) or Programming languages (CS320): lambda calculus, interpreter

  Without a proper understanding of these topics, you will likely struggle in this course.

- Other recommendations which would help you in this course:

    + Basic understanding of computer architecture (CS311)
    + Programming experience in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


## Grading & honor code

#### Cheating

**IMPORTANT: PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. VERY SERIOUS.**

- Cheating is including, but not limited to, the following activities:

    + *Sharing*: code, document, or any products by copying, retyping, **looking at**, or supplying a file​
    + *Describing*: verbal description of code from one person to another
    + *Coaching*: helping your friend to write a lab, line by line​
    + *Searching*: **the Web for solutions​**
    + *Copying*: code from a previous course or online solution​ (you are only allowed to use code we supply)

- Cheating doesn't include the following activities:

    + Explaining how to use systems or tools​
    + Helping others with high-level design issues

- **Cheating will be harshly punished.**

    + I will raise an issue to the Reward and Punishment Committee.
    + Ignorance is no excuse.
    + So don't do it and start early.

- We will use sophisticated tools for detecting code plagiarism​.

    + [Google "code plagiarism detector" for images](https://www.google.com/search?q=code+plagiarism+detector&tbm=isch) and see how these tools can detect "sophisticated" plagiarisms.
      You really cannot escape my catch. Just don't try plagiarism in any form.

### Programming assignments (60%)

TBA

### Tools

Make sure you're capable of using the following development tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): for downloading the homework skeleton and version-controlling your
  development. If you're not familiar with Git, walk through [this
  tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

    + **IMPORTANT**: you should not expose your work to others. In particular, you should not fork
      the [upstream](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431) and push there. Please the following
      steps:

        * Directly clone the upstream without forking it.

          ```bash
          $ git clone --origin upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431.git
          $ cd cs431
          $ git remote -v
          upstream	https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431.git (fetch)
          upstream	https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431.git (push)
          ```

        * To get updates from the upstream, fetch and merge `upstream/main`.

          ```bash
          $ git fetch upstream
          $ git merge upstream/main
          ```

    + If you want to manage your development in a Git server, please create your own private
      repository.

        * You may upgrade your GitHub account to "PRO", which is free of charge.  Refer to the
          [documentation](https://education.github.com/students)

        * Set up your repository as a remote.

          ```bash
          $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git
          $ git remote -v
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git (fetch)
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs431.git (push)
          upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431.git (fetch)
          upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431.git (push)
          ```

        * Push to your repository.

          ```bash
          $ git push -u origin main
          ```

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): as the language of homework implementation. We chose Rust
  because its ownership type system greatly simplifies the development of large-scale system
  software.

  We recommend you to read [this page](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/helpdesk#technical-expertise) that describes how to study Rust.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional): for developing your homework. If you prefer other editors, you're good to go.

- You can connect to server by `ssh s<student-id>@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr -p13001`, e.g., `ssh s20071163@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr -p13001`.

    + **IMPORTANT: Don't try to hack. Don't try to freeze the server. Please be nice.**

    + Your initial password is `123454321`. IMPORTANT: you should change it ASAP.

    + I require you to register public SSH keys to the server. (In March, we'll expire your password so that you can log in only via SSH keys.)
      See [this tutorial](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/) for more information on SSH public key authentication.
      Use `ed25519`.

    + In your client, you may want to set your `~/.ssh/config` as follows for easier SSH access:

      ```
      Host cs431
        Hostname cp-service.kaist.ac.kr
        Port 13001
        User s20071163
      ```

      Then you can connect to the server by `ssh cs431`.

    + Now you can [use it as a VSCode remote server as in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTVuUIhdn_g&list=PL5aMzERQ_OZ8RWqn-XiZLXm1IJuaQbXp0&index=3).

      If you cannot, please contact the head TA in the chat.

    + Sign [the honor code](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/quiz/73/) by September 10th.
      Otherwise, you will be expelled from the class.

### Rules

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431/issues).  You are expected to read all
  announcements within 24 hours of their being posted.  It is highly recommended to watch the
  repository so that new announcements will automatically be delivered to you email address.

- Ask questions on course materials and assignments in [this repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431/issues).
    + Don't send emails to the instructor or TAs for course materials and assignments.
    + Before asking a question, search it in Google and Stack Overflow.
    + Describe your question as detailed as possible. It should include following things:
      * Environment (OS, gcc, g++ version, and any other related program information).
      * Command(s) that you used and the result. Any logs should be formatted in code. Refer to [this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
      * Any directory or file changes you've made. If it is solution file, just describe which part of the code is modified.
      * Googling result. Search before asking, and share the keyword used for searching and what you've learned from it.
    + Give a proper title to your issue.
    + Read [this](https://cp-git.kaist.ac.kr/cs431/cs431#communication) for more instructions.

    + I'm requiring you to ask questions online first for two reasons. First, clearly writing a
      question is the first step to reach an answer. Second, you can benefit from questions and
      answers of other students.

- Ask your questions via email **only if** they are either confidential or personal. Any questions
   failing to do so (e.g. email questions on course materials) will not be answered.

- We are NOT going to discuss *new* questions during the office hour. Before coming to the office
  hour, please check if there is a similar question on the issue tracker. If there isn't, file a new
  issue and start discussion there. The agenda of the office hour will be the issues that are not
  resolved yet.

- Emails to the instructor or the head TA should begin with "CS431:" in the subject line, followed
  by a brief description of the purpose of your email. The content should at least contain your name
  and student number. Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.

- Your Zoom name should be `<your student number> <your name>` (e.g., `20071163 강지훈`).
  Change your name by referring to [this](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363203-Customizing-your-profile).

- This course is conducted in English. But you may ask questions in Korean. Then I will translate it to English.
